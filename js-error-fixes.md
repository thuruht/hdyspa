# JavaScript Error Fixes Summary

This document details the fixes made to resolve JavaScript errors in the Howdy DIY Thrift app.

## 1. CustomEase Errors

Fixed the `"Uncaught Invalid CustomEase"` error by:
- Replacing complex CustomEase declarations with standard GSAP eases
- Replaced `ease: "bounce"` with `ease: "elastic.out(1, 0.3)"`
- Replaced `ease: "slowBounce"` with `ease: "elastic.out(1, 0.2)"`
- Fixed `ease: "bounce.out"` to use the standard `ease: "bounce"` (which is a built-in GSAP ease)

## 2. Reference Errors

Fixed the `"howdySpan is not defined"` and `"archiveButton is not defined"` errors by:
- Correcting variable references in error messages (changed `howdySpan` to `howdyClickElement`)
- Adding proper try-catch blocks around code that might reference missing elements
- Fixed indentation in the archiveButton event listener
- Added error handling for both elements

## 3. Image Loading Issues

Fixed the image loading failures for featured content by:
- Improving the URL handling for featured images to ensure proper paths
- Enhanced error handling for failed image loads
- Added additional logging to make troubleshooting easier
- Maintained the fallback to a default image when loading fails

## Technical Details

1. The CustomEase error was happening because the SVG path syntax provided to the CustomEase plugin was invalid.
2. The reference errors were occurring because of lingering code from the shared codebase that assumed elements would exist that aren't in the Thrift app.
3. The image loading errors might still occur if images are uploaded with incorrect paths, but now there's better error handling and fallback.

## Testing

The script has been verified with `node -c script.js` to confirm there are no syntax errors.
