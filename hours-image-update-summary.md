# Hours Image Update Feature Implementation

## Summary

The hours image update feature has been successfully implemented, allowing admins to replace the hours section image directly from the admin panel. This is essential as the current image will be outdated after July 5th, 2025, and store hours may change weekly.

## Changes Made

1. **Database Updates**:
   - Added `image_url` column to the `content_blocks` table
   - Created migration script in `sql/migration_hours_image.sql`
   - Updated schema.sql with the new column
   - Set default image URL to './mxdiyjuly.png'

2. **Backend API Updates**:
   - Modified content block API endpoints to handle image_url parameter
   - Enhanced the PUT endpoint for /api/content/hours to update image_url
   - Ensured proper initialization of image_url in default content

3. **Admin UI Updates**:
   - Added UI elements to display current hours image
   - Added file input and upload button for new images
   - Added error handling and success messaging
   - Implemented client-side logic to save image changes

4. **Frontend Display Updates**:
   - Updated the hours section to display the image from the database
   - Added GSAP animations for smooth transitions when updating

5. **Documentation**:
   - Created hours-image-feature.md explaining how to use the feature
   - Updated README.md to mention the new feature
   - Added deployment instructions for the database migration

## How to Use

1. Log in to the admin panel
2. Go to the "Edit Hours" section
3. Use the file input to select a new image
4. Click "Upload New Image" to upload it
5. Click "Save Hours Content" to save the changes

## Deployment Steps

To deploy this feature to production:

1. Run the deployment script with the hours image migration:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

2. When prompted about the hours image migration, type 'y' to apply it

## Testing

The feature has been tested locally and works as expected:
- Image upload via the admin panel
- Storing the image URL in the database
- Displaying the uploaded image in the hours section
- Smooth transitions with GSAP animations
