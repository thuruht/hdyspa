# JavaScript Syntax Errors in script.js

This document identifies specific syntax errors in the script.js file. These are actual errors that prevent the script from executing correctly, not just code style issues.

## 1. Unexpected Token '}'

- **Location**: Line 1212
- **Error**: `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}'`
- **Cause**: There is an extra closing brace that doesn't match an opening brace.
- **Details**: This occurs because of the incomplete second `displayEventsPopup` function (starting around line 1068) that doesn't properly close.
- **Verification**: Confirmed by running `node -c script.js`

## 2. Duplicate Function Declaration

- **Location**: 
  - First declaration: Lines 957-1045
  - Second declaration: Lines 1068-1139
- **Error**: Two implementations of the same function
- **Cause**: The code has two different versions of the `displayEventsPopup` function
- **Details**: The first version is complete and has proper error handling. The second version is incomplete, missing closing braces, and causing the syntax error in #1.

## 3. Duplicate Content API Object and Functions

- **Location**: 
  - First declaration: Lines 36-138
  - Second declaration: Lines 181-283
- **Behavior**: The same API functions and event listeners are defined twice
- **Cause**: The content loading code appears to be duplicated
- **Impact**: Each content area is loaded twice, potentially causing flickering or overwriting content

## 4. Scope Issues with Variables

- **Location**: Throughout the file
- **Issue**: Variables like `BASE_URL` are defined within the DOMContentLoaded scope but referenced by functions that appear to be outside that scope
- **Impact**: This can cause "undefined variable" errors if the execution order is not as expected

## Resolution Recommendations

1. Fix the most critical syntax error by removing the incomplete second `displayEventsPopup` function (lines 1068-1139)
2. Remove the duplicate content API declarations and functions (lines 181-283)
3. Ensure all functions that use scope variables like `BASE_URL` are properly enclosed in the correct scope

**Important**: As requested, no code has been removed. This report only identifies the issues so you can decide how to proceed.
