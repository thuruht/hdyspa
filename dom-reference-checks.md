# DOM Reference Checks and Fixes

Based on a review of the DOM elements referenced in the script.js file, the following elements require verification or fixes:

## Elements to Check

| Element Reference | Element ID/Class | Present in HTML | Fix Required |
|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| `.squi-rmbreth` | Footer image | ✅ Present | None |
| `#mission-statement img` | Mission logo | ✅ Present | None |
| `.footer-logo img` | Footer logo | ✅ Present | None |
| `.admin-upload-link button` | Upload button | ❓ Not found | Add check |
| `.view-archives-button` | Archive button | ❓ Not found | Remove or add check |
| `#sort-select` | Sort dropdown | ❓ Not found | Remove or add check |
| `#featured-section` | Featured section | ❌ (should be #featured-content-section) | Update ID |
| `.conic` | Conic images | ❓ Not found | Verify purpose |

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Upload Button**: Add a check before adding event listeners to the upload button.
```javascript
const uploadButton = document.querySelector('.admin-upload-link button');
if (uploadButton) {
  uploadButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    // Existing event handler code
  });
}
```

2. **Archive Button**: This appears to be a comment indicating a feature that might be added back. We should remove or properly comment it:
```javascript
// Archive button - currently disabled but may be added back later
// const archiveButton = document.querySelector('.view-archives-button');
```

3. **Sort Select**: This dropdown appears to be for sorting content, but may not be present in the current HTML. Add a check:
```javascript
const sortSelect = document.getElementById('sort-select');
if (sortSelect) {
  sortSelect.addEventListener('change', (e) => {
    // Existing event handler code
  });
}
```

4. **Featured Section**: Update the selector to use the correct ID:
```javascript
const featuredSection = document.getElementById('featured-content-section');
```

5. **Conic Images**: Need to verify the purpose of these elements and whether they're actually in use.

## Implementation Notes

- Adding null checks before accessing properties or methods of these elements will prevent JavaScript errors
- For elements that are truly no longer needed, we should remove the code rather than just adding null checks
- For elements that are planned for future use, clear comments should be added to explain their purpose
