# Recommended Fixes for Howdy DIY Thrift App

Based on my thorough examination of the codebase, here are the key issues that need to be addressed to fully productionize the Howdy DIY Thrift single-page application:

## 1. Fix DOM Reference Issues

As documented in `dom-reference-checks.md`, there are several DOM references in script.js that need to be fixed:

- Add proper null checks for elements that may not exist, such as:
  - `.admin-upload-link button`
  - `.view-archives-button` 
  - `#sort-select`
- Update the selector for the featured section from `#featured-section` to `#featured-content-section`
- Remove or properly handle any references to `.conic` elements if they aren't used

## 2. Implement the Hours Image Update Feature

The hours image update feature has been partially implemented:
- ✅ Database changes (`image_url` column added to `content_blocks` table)
- ✅ Migration script created (`migration_hours_image.sql`)
- ✅ Backend API endpoints updated to handle image_url
- ✅ Documentation created for the feature

However, the admin UI implementation is incomplete:
- The admin.js file does not include UI elements for image upload in the hours editor section
- The updateHours function in admin.js does not handle the image_url parameter
- There's no file input or upload button in the hours editor UI
- The event handler for the image upload is missing

## 3. Fully Remove Slideshow and Toggle State Code

While most of this code has been removed as noted in fix-progress.md, we should:
- Verify all slideshow-related code is completely removed
- Consider if the toggle state functionality is needed (it may be legacy code from the shared codebase)

## 4. Fix ansik.js CustomEase Issues

The ansik.js file has potential CustomEase issues similar to those fixed in script.js:
- The CustomEase.create("customBounce", "M0,0 C0.25,0.1 0.25,1 1,1") might need to be replaced with standard GSAP eases
- DOMContentLoaded event handler is not properly structured (some code appears to be outside the handler)

## 5. Complete the Documentation

The DOCUMENTATION.md file is incomplete:
- Several sections have empty bullet points or incomplete information
- The hours image feature should be added to the documentation

## 6. Implement Testing Plan

Create a comprehensive testing plan to ensure all features work correctly:
- Test all frontend features in different browsers
- Verify all admin functionality works as expected
- Test CORS handling for media files from R2
- Ensure proper error handling for all user interactions

## Next Steps

1. First, implement the missing hours image upload feature in admin.js
2. Fix the DOM reference issues in script.js
3. Fix the CustomEase issues in ansik.js
4. Complete the documentation
5. Test thoroughly before final deployment

The most critical issue is the incomplete hours image upload feature, as this functionality is needed for updating the store hours, which will change after July 5th, 2025.
